About the Project
Tech Navigator is a dynamic web application designed to streamline the process of finding tech upskilling opportunities. Whether you're looking for a certification, a new course, or a challenging internship, this tool offers two powerful search modes:

AI-Powered Search: Leverages the Gemini API to intelligently parse your queries and return structured results for exams, courses, and internships.
Manual Google Search: Opens a new tab with a highly refined Google search query, designed to target educational and career-focused platforms for broader results.
The application features a modern, eye-pleasing dark theme with glassmorphism elements, providing an engaging user experience.
